    Notes:
        The W3.css was very helpful for this project, alongside their templates. For the last assignment I learned how to use Bootstrap, and knowing how to use that with its class system for the css made it very easy to understand W3.css. To my knowledge the entire website is responsive, the only issue is my message which changes at the top of the page 
        can move the entire site a bit, which is something I need fixing. I didn't have a lot of time to work on this due to being sick, but I think it turned out well.
